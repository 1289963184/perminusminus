Path labeling is a generalized task for many problems. The task is illustrated as the figure bellow.

Suppose we have a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with nodes ( in blue boxes ) shown above. The directions of the edges are determined by the indexes of the nodes in white. All the edges are from the nodes with small indexes.

Each node may have some features (in gray) from a finite set which are observable. We can give some nodes in this graph labels (in white) from a finite set.

Path labeling task is to find a path from the initial nodes (diamond shape) to the terminal nodes (double circle) and give each node on this path a label.

=Special Cases=
  * If only one label is possible for each node, the problem degrades to a *path finding* problem.
  * If the DAG is only a sequence and with only one initial node and one terminal node, the problem degrades to a *sequence labeling* problem.
    ** If the sequence has only one node which is both initial and terminal, the problem degrades to a *classification* problem.
