This example is to use `per~~.exe` to do Chinese word segmentation (CWS).

We model CWS as character sequence labeling like some researchers did.

The data we used is the MSR corpus in SIGHAN bakeoff 2005. You can download the data there for free. File `msr_training.utf8` is used as the training data. File `msr_test_gold.utf8` is used as the test data.

The file `cws_transform.py` is used to transform segmented Chinese text files to binary files that `per~~.exe` can read. The command lines are:

{{{
c:\python31\python.exe cws_transform.py l "msr_training.utf8" "training.bin" "index.json"

c:\python31\python.exe cws_transform.py p "index.json" "msr_test_gold.utf8" "test.bin"
}}}

These processes are illustrated as the figure bellow:

Then we use these command lines to learn and predict.

{{{
per~~.exe l "training.bin" "model.bin" 20

per~~.exe p "model.bin" "test.bin" "result.txt" 0
}}}
which can be illustrated as the figure bellow:

Finally, the `eval.py` file is used for the evaluation.

the result is
{{{
precision: 0.965508200278, recall: 0.963313427989, F1: 0.964409565437
}}}

Comparing with the official [http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2005/data/results.php.htm collected results], our F1 is the same as the No. 1 result.
